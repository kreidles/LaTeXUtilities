\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

Here is the mind-blowing introduction to my dissertation.  It is so awesome, you
had better sit down.  Here's some stuff another dude did \citep{article_2007}.

\lipsum

\chapter{INCREDIBLY GREAT PAPER 1%
\footnote{This chapter has been submitted for publication to the Journal of
Something Really Important by Coauthor 1 and Coauthor 2.%
}}


\section{Summary}

So you are not allowed to display an abstract in UCD formatting rules.
If you still want your abstract for each separate paper, you can add a summary
section, like this. \blindtext

\section{Introduction}

Intro stuff. \lipsum[2]

\section{Notation}

Notation section, because everyone loves math. \lipsum[3]

\section{New Methods}

Because every Ph.D. wants to make something new and fancy.

\lipsum


\section{Simulation experiment}

Because we love made up data.

\Blindtext


\section{Discussion}

Some interpretations that we totally pulled out of our, well you get the point.

\Blindtext

\chapter{MY SECOND PAPER%
\footnote{This chapter has been submitted for publication to the Journal of Perpretual Rejection
by Coauthor 1, Coauthor2, and Coauthor 3.%
}\label{chap:paper2}}


\section{Summary}

Abstract of paper 2 \blindtext


\section{Introduction}

Wow, look at all the cool stuff I did.  You should really hire me.

\lipsum[2]


\section{Notation}

More cool math. 

\blindlist{itemize}

For $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ independent and identically distributed
from a distribution with finite mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2,$ as $n
\rightarrow \infty$ \[ \sqrt{n} \left( \bar{X}_n - \mu \right)
\stackrel{\mathcal{L}}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{N} \left(0, \sigma^2 \right).\]

Of course you'll need to reference equation~\eqref{eq:one} too.

\begin{equation}
  1 = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi \left(x \right) \mathrm{d}x 
  \label{eq:one}
\end{equation}


\section{Simulation study}

Fake data are my favorite kind of data.

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{quokka.jpg}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Behold! The happy quokka.  Also, notice that Figure captions go below the figure}
\end{figure}

And now, a table.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Why quokkas are happier than you (table captions go above the table)}
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline 
 & Writing a dissertation?\tabularnewline
\hline 
Quokkas & No\tabularnewline
You & Yes\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}

\end{table}

\section{Conclusions}

Seriously, I really need a job and look at all the stuff I just wrote!

\chapter{MY THIRD PAPER%
\footnote{This chapter has been submitted for publication to Journal of We Secretly Love Listening 
to Abba, by Coauthor 1, Coauthor 2, Coauthor 3, and Coauthor 4.%
}}


\section{Summary}

Abstract for Paper 3 goes here. 

\blindtext


\section{Introduction}

Paper 3 will melt your eyeballs with intellectual glory.

\lipsum


\section{Notation}

I am just going to assume that every dissertation should include math,
because I am a statistician and you should be one too when you grow up.

\blindlist{itemize}



\section{New Methods}

Here is cool new math that I made up after a caffeine crazed evening
with a multivariate theory book.

\ctable[caption={Counts and row percentages for those who died by the primary
predictor, BMI, in three formats, and the secondary predictor variables as well.
Logistic regression results are presented for estimating the odds of death.

\section{Applied example}

Here's how to use my cool methods on real data, because I got bored with 
simulations.  And they take too long to run, anyway.



\section{Discussion}

Don't say I didn't warn you about the eyeball melting thing.

\chapter{BIG EPIC CONCLUSION CHAPTER}

OMG, wasn't my dissertation like the coolest thing ever???!!!!

Yes it is.  So is the Colorado Avalanche winning the central division see
Figure~\ref{fig:avs-central-champs}!

\chapter{MIND-ALTERING APPENDIX}

No specific formatting rules for appendices, but make sure it is awesome.  Also, here's an example of the theorem environment.

\section{Theorems}

\begin{theorem}

  Some stuff is true~\citep{article_2008}.
